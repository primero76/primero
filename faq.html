        <p class="question">
            1. Why can't I open the book flights page?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
            In order to book flights from this website, you have to make sure that you are signed in with
            your account. You can sign up if you do not have an account.
            After logging in, you can visit the Book page in the navigation bar and book your flights to travel
            anywhere in Pakistan.
        </p>
        <p class="question">
            2. Can I select seats of the same class i.e. Business and Economy?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
            No, you can not select seats of the same class simultaneously. However, if you want to select seats
            of the same class, you can first book the seats for the business class and then the seats for the economy
            class, or vice-versa.
        </p>
        <p class="question">
            3. Why can't I select any seat from my flight?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
            If you are not able to select seats in the seat selection phase of your desirable flight, 
            it probably means that all of the seats are booked and therefore, they are unavailable.
        </p>
        <p class="question">
            4. Is there an option for a return ticket or a multi-city ticket?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
            Currently, features regarding return tickets or multi-city tickets are unavailable. 
            If you want to buy a return ticket, you can simply buy two one-way tickets for vice-versa source and
            destination.
